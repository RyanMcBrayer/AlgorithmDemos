# Algorithm Demos
A few demonstrations of algorithmic problems, implemented in Java.

These demos include Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming, and Network Flow.
They are implemented in Java.
Please see the PDF file in each folder for a full problem explanation, input format, and expected output.

# Line Intersections Problem (Divide and Conquer)
Given n lines with endpoints on x=0 and x=1, count the number of intersections between the lines.

# Knapsack Problem (Dynamic Programming)
You have a knapsack of capacity c, given a sequence of n items with wieghts w and values v,
find the optimal packing to maximimize the value of items while being within the capacity constraint.

# Online Caching Problem (Greedy)
Given a cache of size k and a sequence of n requests, implement an optimal eviction policy to
minimize the number of faults.

# Bipartite Matching Problem (Network Flow)
Given a graph that descibes the relationship between two sets A and B, find the value
of the maximum matching between the sets and determine if a perfect matching is possible.
